Content for AUT401 - Building AR and AI automotive owner applications with AWS

## Abstract
Augmented reality (AR), AI, and IoT services can be used to jointly create both visual and aural owner applications, such as an interactive ownerâ€™s manual. This session is dedicated to selecting and applying the appropriate AWS tools and services to build interactive owner applications for increasing after-market sales, personalization/localization of services, next-generation design, advertising, and media distribution. Developers and UX designers learn how to easily create applications that reinvent the way we interact with our vehicles in both the physical and digital worlds. Please bring your laptop.

## Step 1 (deploying AWS CloudFormation template)
Clicking a button below (and following a wizard), deploy `AWS CloudFormation` stack into your account and `us-east-1` region. 
This stack deploys:
* `Amazon Cognito` identity pool (and associated `AWS IAM` role), that allows `Amazon Sumerian` scene to talk to other services
* `Amazon DynamoDB` table, that will contain manual functions, their steps and descriptions, we want to support. (one initial function for geashift/shifter will be already stored in this table)
* `AWS Lambda` function (and associated `AWS IAM` role) that helps `Amazon Lex` bot access `Amazon DynamoDB` table

## Step 2 (importing AWS Lex bot)
Download `AWS Lex` [package in .zip format into your computer from here](https://www.google.com). Navigate to `AWS Lex` service in `us-east-1` region, import the zip file that you've downloaded. You will now see `ARsteering` bot in your console. At the bottom of a page of particular intent, link the intent to `AWS Lambda` function called `ARsteering`, that was provisioned by `AWS CloudFormation` in Step 1. Build the bot, test it and publish them under the alias `latest`.

## Step 3 (importing Amazon Sumerian scene)
Download `Amazon Sumerian` [scene export in .zip format into your computer from here](https://www.google.com). Navigate to `Amazon Sumerian` service in `us-east-1` region and create a new empty scene. After the scene loads, delete `Default lightning` entity collection and rename the `Default Camera` entity to `Old Camera` (this is to avoid having multiple of these entities/collections after we import the .zip). We then drag and drop the downloaded .zip onto the canvas of our `Amazon Sumerian` scene. After the import finishes, multiple entities appear in our scene. 
### Explore the scene and entity collections
Get use to Sumerian interface, understand:
* panel of entities (where our steering wheel model, HTML UI, cameras and light sources live)
* panel of assets (where are scripts and state machines live)
* canvas (where you see a preview of the scene)
* panel of components (where every entity has associated properties - like color, size and position, state machines, scripts, speech files and/or dialogs)
### Setting up Cognito
Before we play the scene, we need to
### Setting up Lex
### Changing accent colors and highlight colors

## Step 4 (adding another commands)
